    "When you start a new line after a colon your code (if writing with an IDE or code editor) you should find your cursor indented ready to start typing.  Lines will keep indenting until you press backspace.  Python knows that anything indented is inside the structure with the colon - in this case the **if**.  Indenting is considered good practice in all programming languages as it makes code easier to read but in Python it is even more important as it affects how the code is interpreted and you will get errors if not indented correctly."
